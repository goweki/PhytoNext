# Machine Learning for Crop Improvement

## Overview

Machine learning (ML) offers powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets in plant breeding. By leveraging computational models, we can detect subtle genetic patterns and predict crop performance with high precision.

## Applications

- **Yield Prediction**: Using ML algorithms to model yield outcomes under diverse environments.
- **Trait Discovery**: Identifying genes associated with **disease resistance**, **flowering time**, and **nutrient efficiency**.
- **High-throughput Phenotyping**: Integrating image data with ML to automate trait measurement.

## Tools & Frameworks

- **R Shiny dashboards** for interactive exploration.
- **Python ML libraries** (scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow).
- **Bioinformatics pipelines** optimized for plant datasets.

## Impact

ML enables **faster breeding cycles**, reduces costs, and supports the development of crops adapted to **climate change** and **global food security challenges**.
