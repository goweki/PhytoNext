# Genomic Selection in Miscanthus Breeding

## Overview

Miscanthus, a perennial bioenergy crop, has significant potential for sustainable energy production. Traditional breeding is often slow due to its long growth cycles. **Genomic selection (GS)** accelerates this process by predicting plant performance using genetic markers.

## Objectives

- Implement GS to enhance **biomass yield** and **stress tolerance**.
- Develop predictive models that integrate **genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data**.
- Apply **machine learning** to improve selection accuracy.

## Current Progress

- Established high-density **genotyping datasets** from breeding populations.
- Developed **R Shiny applications** for interactive data visualization.
- Integrated **bioinformatics pipelines** for marker-trait association.

## Future Directions

- Scaling up genomic prediction models across larger and more diverse populations.
- Applying GS methodologies to other biomass and **climate-resilient crops**.
