# Bioinformatics Pipelines

## Overview

Modern plant science relies on high-throughput sequencing data. Efficient **bioinformatics pipelines** are essential for analyzing large-scale genomic datasets and translating raw data into biological insights.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Quality control with _FastQC_
   - Read trimming using _Trimmomatic_

2. **Genome Assembly & Alignment**

   - Reference-based alignment with _BWA_ or _HISAT2_
   - De novo assembly with _SPAdes_

3. **Variant Calling**

   - SNP and indel detection with _GATK_
   - Structural variation analysis

4. **Annotation & Functional Analysis**
   - Gene annotation with _Augustus_
   - Pathway analysis using _KEGG_ and _GO_ terms

## Applications

- Identifying **candidate genes** linked to crop improvement.
- Supporting **genomic selection pipelines**.
- Generating **marker datasets** for breeding programs.
