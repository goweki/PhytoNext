# Data Visualization with R Shiny

## Overview

**R Shiny** provides interactive and user-friendly web applications for exploring complex datasets. In plant breeding, it helps researchers and stakeholders visualize results without requiring programming knowledge.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Filter, sort, and drill down into genomic datasets.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize trait distributions, genomic predictions, and correlations.
- **Reproducibility**: Share standardized analytical workflows across teams.

## Example Applications

- **Genomic Prediction Viewer**: Compare predicted vs observed breeding values.
- **Trait Explorer**: Interactive plots for multi-environment trial data.
- **Population Structure Dashboard**: PCA and clustering visualizations.

## Benefits

- Makes **complex analyses accessible** to non-technical users.
- Improves **decision-making** in breeding programs.
- Bridges the gap between **data science and plant biology**.
